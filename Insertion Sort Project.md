 # Insertion Sort Project 

## Project 1

[**22,27,16,2,18,6**] 

#### Insertion Sort Steps

1-[22,27,**16**,2,18,6]

2-[22,**16**,27,2,18,6]

3-[**16**,22,27,2,18,6]

4-[16,22,**2**,27,18,6]

5-[16,**2**,22,27,18,6]

6-[**2**,16,22,27,18,6]

7-[2,16,22,**18**,27,6]

8-[2,16,**18**,22,27,6]

9-[2,16,18,22,**6**,27]

10-[2,16,18,**6**,22,27]

11-[2,16,**6**,18,22,27]

12-[2,**6**,16,18,22,27]

### Big-O Notation

```
Best case    : O(n)
Average case : O(n^2)
Worst case   : O(n^2)
```

### Time Complexity

```
Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle.
Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end.
Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning.
```

### Which case will 18 be taken from after the series is sorted?

Average case
